## Geoscience Education Research & Paleontology at WWU

Welcome! Here in the Dahl Research Group we do a lot of geoscience education research (GER) and a little bit of paleontology research. Head on over the research page to learn about current and past research projects, or check out the people page to see what types of projects current and former students have worked while part of the Dahl Research Group.

If you are interested in joining my research group, please contact me via email. I'm always interested in bringing in new undergraduate and masters students!
