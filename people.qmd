I am an associate professor of geology and science education, and a member of both the [Geology Department](https://geology.wwu.edu/) and the [SMATE (Science, Math and Technology Education) Group](https://smate.wwu.edu/) at [Western Washington University](https://www.wwu.edu/). I earned both my PhD and MS in Earth Science at the [University of Riverside, CA](https://epsci.ucr.edu/) and my BA in Geology at [Oberlin College](https://www.oberlin.edu/arts-and-sciences/departments/geosciences).

My professional training is in marine paleoecology, with a focus on Ordovician gastropod evolution, but I have also developed a research program in geoscience education, with a focus on equity and justice in geoscience.

I am a member of the [Paleontological Society](https://www.paleosoc.org/) (PS), the [Geological Society of America](https://www.geosociety.org/) (GSA), and the [National Association of Geoscience Teachers](https://nagt.org/index.html) (NAGT). I have previously served on the [Geoscience Advisory Committee](https://new.nsf.gov/geo/advisory-committee) for the National Science Foundation and the management board of the [Geoscience Education Division](https://community.geosociety.org/gedivision/home) of GSA.
