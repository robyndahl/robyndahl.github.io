This interest has led to research projects on:\n\nGeoscience identity formation: how undergraduate students develop their sense of identity as a geoscientist\nLab Camp: a more accessible and inclusive alternative to traditional field camp\nCritical educational transitions: identifying and mitigating the barriers that geoscience students encounter as they transition from institution to institution or educational stage to stage\nAcademic hiring networks: using social network analysis to identify patterns of inequity in academic hiring in geoscience\nDigitized 3D models: examining how students interact with and learn from digitizd specimen models\n\nCheck out some models of WWU Geology Department specimens at our Sketchfab repository"

The course uses a student-oriented pedagogy with an integrated content focus to help students develop important ideas in physical science.\n\n\n\nSCED 202: Matter & Energy in the Earth System\n\nThis course is one of a 4 course series designed for prospective elementary teachers but open to all students. The course uses a student-oriented pedagogy with an integrated content focus to help students develop important ideas in earth science.\n\n\n\nSCED 370: STEM & Society\n\nIn this course, we will explore the meaning and importance of scientific literacy and consider how scientific literacy relates to issues of equity and social justice. We will discuss different types of scientific controversy, study how scientific research is portrayed in news and popular media, and examine frameworks for teaching scientific literacy at the secondary level."
